  how it works...

# Editing Content

{% hint style="info" %}
Working with the Editor There are dynamic elements that are being rendered from Shopify and there are Builder elements that gets added ("Hydrated") after the page loads

Thats why you can't edit all of the elements on the page, but the most of them are editable.
{% endhint %}

### #1 Locating a Dynamic Builder.io Element

{% hint style="info" %}
This can be done by seeing a blue outline on an element, this means that the element is loaded by the Builder.io API and its fully editable.
{% endhint %}

### #2 Edit the content of the Dynamic Element

{% hint style="info" %}
By double clicking on the element a menu will pop that allows you to edit the element's text and other properties, changes auto update and render on the front.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
There are a lot of options on all of the element's properties, it's better to experiment on an empty page until a good knowledge on all of them is made.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### #3 Publish update when ready

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to display changes to the page you should publish the changes when ready using the "Publish Update" Button located at the top right corner
{% endhint %}
